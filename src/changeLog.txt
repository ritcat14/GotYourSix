23/09 - Added UI button events

24/09 - Story line intro:

 IDEA: Start off in a bedroom, with bed and crate. crate contains armour (beginners). Tutorial/helper advises equiping the armour
 (introduction to equiping, and give knowledge that armour is required to survive).
 Arrows indicate health, food, water etc. bars, explaing what they're for.
 
 Buttons toggle levels. Player can be shot and take damage on collision, and can kill enemies. Weapon upgrade at level 2.
 
26/10 - UPDATE:
 weapon bar added, minimap removed until layers have been fully implemented, and all events handled by corresponding layer. Player has
 shooting and swimming animations that need to be implemented. Need to add in player doing rendom things if left alone for a certain 
 amount of time. Start menu added and file handling begun. Need to implement 
 
30/10 - UPDATE:
 Started implementing new GUI design for start screen and menu's. Also started implementing player variations (male/female, fire/ice). 
 Plan to change player state to playerViewState, making playerViewState plublic and static, to be accessed even after start screen is
 removed. Use state.toString() method as spritesheet file name
